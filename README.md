## Novel Viewpoint Generation
PLINK can be used to generate a high quality synthetic LiDAR scans from previously unvisited locations. Here we show how a probabilistic framework is better suited for learning a continuous scene representation from messy raw LiDAR data. PLINK is particularly well suited for handling unstructured enviornments with porous and partially reflective surfaces, and can even be used with an improperly calibrated sensor.
